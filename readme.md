## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive strategic analysis of SpeedTalk Mobile, a provider of prepaid SIM cards. The goal of this case study was to perform a deep-dive audit of the brand's digital presence‚Äîspanning their website, Amazon store, and market positioning‚Äîto identify critical threats and uncover high-impact growth opportunities.

This analysis was conducted as part of a final-round interview task for a digital marketing agency, demonstrating my ability to deliver actionable, data-driven insights even with limited resources.

## üéØ Key Objectives

*   **Holistic Audit:** Analyze the brand from multiple perspectives: customer experience (UX), technical performance (SEO & Speed), and business strategy.
*   **Threat Identification:** Uncover critical issues negatively impacting revenue, brand reputation, and marketing ROI.
*   **Opportunity Discovery:** Identify untapped market segments and keyword gaps that competitors are overlooking.
*   **Actionable Strategy:** Formulate a clear, 3-phase, 90-day plan to address all findings and drive measurable growth.

## üõ† Methodology & "Guerrilla" Tactics

In the absence of premium enterprise tools, this analysis was performed using a combination of resourceful "guerrilla" research techniques:

1.  **Technical Audit:** Utilized browser-based tools like Google Lighthouse to assess website performance, accessibility, and SEO health.
2.  **Amazon SERP Analysis:** Manually analyzed Amazon search result pages to understand product positioning, ad strategy, and competitive landscape.
3.  **Customer Sentiment Analysis:** Scraped and synthesized over 50 customer reviews to identify recurring pain points, product strengths, and the core customer persona.
4.  **Keyword "Autocomplete" Mining:** Leveraged Amazon's search suggestions to find high-intent, long-tail keywords.
5.  **Competitor & Reseller Investigation:** Used tools like Keepa (free tier) to diagnose Buy Box loss and investigate the impact of 3rd-party resellers on brand health.

## üîë Summary of Findings & Core Recommendations

The analysis revealed that while SpeedTalk Mobile has a strong product offering, its growth is significantly hampered by three core issues:

1.  **Critical Brand Trust Deficit:** A recurring theme of "scam" and "stolen credit card" in reviews points to a severe trust issue that must be addressed immediately.
2.  **Revenue Leakage & Brand Damage:** The brand consistently loses ~10% of the Buy Box to unauthorized resellers who provide a poor customer experience, directly harming brand reputation and wasting ad spend.
3.  **Significant Missed Markets:** The analysis uncovered two massive, untapped markets:
    *   **The "Connected Camera" Niche:** Over 2,100 monthly searches for `sim card for camera`.
    *   **The Spanish-Speaking Market:** Over 5,600 monthly searches for `rastreador gps para carros`.

The proposed solution is a **90-day strategic plan** focused on a "Trust Overhaul" of all marketing copy, implementing a proactive Brand Protection Protocol, and launching targeted campaigns to capture these new markets.
